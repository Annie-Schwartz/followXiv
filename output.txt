Title: Quantum Speed Limit and Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation under Feedback Control
Authors: ['Hayato Yunoki', 'Yoshihiko Hasegawa']
Abstract: Quantum feedback control is a technique for controlling quantum dynamics by applying control inputs to the quantum system based on the results of measurements performed on the system. It is an important technique from both an applied and a fundamental theoretical point of view. There are two fundamental inequalities that describe trade-off relations in quantum mechanics, namely, the quantum speed limit and the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. They characterize the operational limit of non-equilibrium quantum systems, making them essential for controlling such systems. Therefore, it is meaningful to formulate these trade-off relations within the framework of quantum feedback control. In this paper, we derive these inequalities based on the continuous matrix product state method. Additionally, we analytically derive the exact form of quantum dynamical activity under feedback control, which serves as the cost term in these inequalities. Specifically, we focus on the cases of Markovian feedback, i.e., the direct feedback of continuous measurement results. Our numerical analysis reveals that the presence of feedback control can improve the quantum speed limit time and the quality of continuous measurements. Thus, our work clarifies how feedback control affects these important trade-off relationships in quantum mechanics.

Title: Controlling Symmetries and Quantum Criticality in the Anisotropic Coupled-Top Model
Authors: ['Wen-Jian Mao', 'Tian Ye', 'Liwei Duan', 'Yan-Zhi Wang']
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic coupled-top model, which describes the interactions between two large spins along both $x-$ and $y-$directions. By tuning anisotropic coupling strengths along distinct directions, we can manipulate the system's symmetry, inducing either discrete $Z_2$ or continuous U(1) symmetry. In the thermodynamic limit, the mean-field phase diagram is divided into five phases: the disordered paramagnetic phase, the ordered ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phases with symmetry breaking along either $x-$ or $y-$direction. This results in a double degeneracy of the spin projections along the principal direction for $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. When U(1) symmetry is broken, infinite degeneracy associated with the Goldstone mode emerges. Beyond the mean-field ansatz, at the critical points, the energy gap closes, and both quantum fluctuations and entanglement entropy diverge, signaling the onset of second-order quantum phase transitions. These critical behaviors consistently support the universality class of $Z_2$ symmetry. Contrarily, when U(1) symmetry is broken, the energy gap vanishes beyond the critical points, yielding a novel exponent of 1, rather than 1/2 for $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. The framework provides an ideal platform for experimentally controlling symmetries and investigating associated physical phenomena.

Title: Black Box Work Extraction and Composite Hypothesis Testing
Authors: ['Kaito Watanabe', 'Ryuji Takagi']
Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory. We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.

Title: Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain
Authors: ['Rishabh Jha', 'Salvatore R. Manmana', 'Stefan Kehrein']
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.

Title: Machine-Learning Detection of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions
Authors: ['Masahito Mochizuki', 'Yusuke Miyajima']
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is a typical topological phase transition defined between binding and unbinding states of vortices and antivortices, which is not accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is known that the BKT transition is difficult to detect from thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and magnetic susceptibility because of the absence of anomaly in free energy and significant finite-size effects. Therefore, methods based on statistical mechanics which are commonly used to discuss phase transitions cannot be easily applied to the BKT transition. In recent years, several attempts to detect the BKT transition using machine-learning methods based on image recognition techniques have been reported. However, it has turned out that the detection is difficult even for machine learning methods because of the absence of trivial order parameters and symmetry breaking. Most of the methods proposed so far require prior knowledge about the models and/or preprocessing of input data for feature engineering, which is problematic in terms of the general applicability. In this article, we introduce recent development of the machine-learning methods to detect the BKT transitions in several spin models. Specifically, we demonstrate the success of two new methods named temperature-identification method and phase-classification method for detecting the BKT transitions in the q-state clock model and the XXZ model. This progress is expected to sublimate the machine-learning-based study of spin models for exploring new physics beyond simple benchmark test.

Title: Thermodynamics of multi-colored loop models in three dimensions
Authors: ['Soumya Kanti Ganguly', 'Sumanta Mukherjee', 'Chandan Dasgupta']
Abstract: We study order-disorder transitions in three-dimensional \textsl{multi-colored} loop models using Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the nature of the transition is intimately related to the nature of the loops. The symmetric loops undergo a first order phase transition, while the non-symmetric loops show a second-order transition. The critical exponents for the non-symmetric loops are calculated. In three dimensions, the regular loop model with no interactions is dual to the XY model. We argue that, due to interactions among the colors, the specific heat exponent is found to be different from that of the regular loop model. The continuous nature of the transition is altered to a discontinuous one due to the strong inter-color interactions.

Title: A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events
Authors: ['Jordi Baró', 'Álvaro Corral']
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.
